# Agile/Scrum 
## Key Concepts
- PBI - (Product Backlog Item)
    - An ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product (also known as Master Story list)
- Spring Backlog 
    - The set of Backlog items selected to be delivered over a period of time.
- Minimum Viable Product 
    - The bare minimum product that meets the client's expectations. Includes all must haves and excludes all nice to haves (no bells and whistles).

## Agile Team 
Product Owner
- Represents the or is the end customer. Defines what is valuable and priorities (owns the backlog).

Scrum Master
- Facilitates team meetings, removes team impediments, liaises with the product owner and ensures the team remains on track. 

Delivery Team 
- The people in charge of execution or that are also part of the project's implementation (e.g. developers, testers, business analysts, etc.)
- Defines what user stories are part of a sprint. 

## Tools 
Burn down chart 
- A chart that shows the remaining work to be done, progress over time and the team's velocity (point delivered in a sprint.)
- On the X axis you have time (sprints) and on the Y axis effort (story points).

Kanban/Agile board 
- A visual/pull system to track work and progress in a logical/basic flow (from left to right):
    - To Do > In Progress > In Review or In QA (optional) > Done

## Rituals 
Sprint Planning 
- Meeting where the team defines which user stories they will work on in an upcoming sprint. 

Daily stand-ups 
- 15min daily meeting where people stand up near the Kanban board and share what they did yesterday, what they are doing today and impediments (if any).

Sprint Review(Demo/Showcase)
- Meeting where the team presents what they have delivered over a sprint to the product owner. 

Retrospectives 
- Meetings done after sprints to review, revise and adjust (similar to a lessons learned, but in real time, not just at the end of the project).
