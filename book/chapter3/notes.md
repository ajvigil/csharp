## operating on variables 
 
 > **operators** apply simple operations such as addition and multiplication to **operands** such as variables and literal values. 

- most operators are binary, meaning that they work on two operands, as shown in the following pseudocode

```cs
var resultOfOperation = firstOperand operator secondOperand;
```

- some operators are unary, meaning they work on a single operand, and can apply before or after the operand, as shown. 

```cs
var resultOfOperation = onlyOperand operator;
var resultOfOperation2 = operator onlyOperand;
```
