# Improving Performance and Scalability Using Multitasking

## Understanding processes, threads, and tasks
A **process** has resources, like memory and threads allocated to it. 
- a **thread** executes your code, statement by statement. 
- by default, each process only has one thread, and this can cause problems when we need to do more than one **task** at the same time. 
- threads are also responsible for keeping track of things like the currently authenticated user any any internationalization rules that should be followed for the current language and region.
